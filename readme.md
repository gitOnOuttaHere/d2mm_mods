My take on a good D2 experience for solo self-found (SSF). I have not run through the game with all of these mods enable yet.

My goals
* Better rare item drops
* Slight increase to exceptional and elite items drop rates
* Remove weapon restrictions for runewords
* Runes/Gems stack

Other areas I would like to improve
* I get tired of alt+tabbing to look up runewords. I want the list in the game.
* Make Act 1, 3, and 5 mercs worth something
* Improved crafting recipies with different levels (like runewords)
